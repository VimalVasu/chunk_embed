# Debug Log - Chunking & Embedding Service

## Purpose
This file tracks errors, debugging sessions, and resolution strategies encountered during development of the Chunking & Embedding Service.

## Log Format
Each entry should include:
- **Date/Time**: When the error occurred
- **Component**: Which module/task was being worked on
- **Error Type**: Category of error (Import, Runtime, Logic, Configuration, etc.)
- **Description**: What happened and expected vs actual behavior
- **Root Cause**: What caused the issue
- **Resolution**: How it was fixed
- **Prevention**: Steps to avoid similar issues

## Error Log Entries

### [2025-01-15 14:30] - Task 4.2 Complete - Hash-based Chunk ID Generation
**Component**: Task 4.2 - Chunker Module
**Error Type**: None - Successful Implementation
**Description**: 
Successfully implemented hash-based chunk ID generation scheme for idempotency. The implementation includes:
- Deterministic SHA-256 hash generation using content, timestamps, and metadata
- Content normalization for consistent hashing (case-insensitive, whitespace handling)
- Collision detection and handling mechanisms
- Comprehensive test suite with 98% coverage (31 passing tests)
- Integration with chunker abstract base class

**Root Cause**: 
N/A - Implementation was successful

**Resolution**: 
Task completed successfully with all tests passing and meeting the 90%+ coverage requirement.

**Prevention**: 
N/A - No issues encountered

## Debugging Strategies

### For Import Errors
1. Check virtual environment activation
2. Verify requirements.txt is up to date
3. Check Python path and module structure
4. Use `pip list` to verify installed packages

### For API Errors
1. Verify API keys are properly set
2. Check network connectivity
3. Validate request format
4. Test with minimal examples
5. Check rate limits and quotas

### For ChromaDB Issues
1. Verify ChromaDB installation and version
2. Check database file permissions
3. Test connection with simple operations
4. Validate collection schema

### For Data Processing
1. Validate input data format
2. Add detailed logging at each processing step
3. Test with minimal datasets
4. Check boundary conditions

## Performance Monitoring

### Memory Usage
- Track memory consumption during large file processing
- Monitor for memory leaks in long-running operations
- Profile memory usage by component

### Processing Time
- Benchmark chunking performance by strategy
- Monitor embedding generation latency
- Track database operation times

### Resource Utilization
- CPU usage during concurrent operations
- Network bandwidth for API calls
- Disk I/O for large transcript files

---

## Testing Debug Notes
