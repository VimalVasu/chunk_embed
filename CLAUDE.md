## 5. Allowed Tools & Permissions

By default, Claude will prompt before running:
- **File operations** (`Edit`, `Move`, `Delete`)  
- **Shell commands** (`npm run dev`, `ffmpeg`, `supabase db push`)  

To streamline common tasks, consider preâ€‘allowing:
```jsonc
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Edit", 
    "Bash(npm run dev)", 
    "Bash(ffmpeg *)", 
    "Bash(supabase *)"
  ]
}
