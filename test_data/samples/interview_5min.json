      "start_time": 12.6,
      "end_time": 21.4,
      "text": "Great. Let's start with a coding question. I'd like you to implement a function that finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string."

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 22.0,
      "end_time": 29.7,
      "text": "Alright. To clarify, should I optimize for time complexity or space complexity? And are there any constraints on the input size?"

      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "start_time": 30.2,
      "end_time": 37.8,

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 38.4,
      "end_time": 52.1,
      "text": "Okay. I think I'll use the expand around centers approach. For each character and each pair of characters, I'll expand outward while the characters match, keeping track of the longest palindrome found."
    },
    {
      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "start_time": 52.7,
      "end_time": 57.9,
      "text": "That sounds like a solid approach. Can you walk me through the time complexity?"

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 58.5,
      "end_time": 71.2,
      "text": "Sure. We have O(n) possible centers, and for each center we might expand up to O(n) characters in the worst case, so the overall time complexity would be O(n squared)."

      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "start_time": 71.8,
      "end_time": 79.4,
      "text": "Excellent. Now let's move to a system design question. How would you design a URL shortening service like bit.ly?"

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 80.0,
      "end_time": 91.6,
      "text": "I'd start by understanding the requirements. We need to shorten URLs, redirect users to original URLs, and handle a large number of requests. Should I assume a specific scale?"

      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "start_time": 92.2,

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 100.4,
      "end_time": 115.7,
      "text": "Given that scale, I'd use a distributed system. For the core components, I'd have a URL encoding service, a database for mappings, a cache layer for popular URLs, and load balancers to distribute traffic."

      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 116.3,
      "end_time": 127.9,
      "text": "For the encoding algorithm, I might use base62 encoding with a counter or hash-based approach. The database could be partitioned by the short URL key for better performance."

      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "start_time": 128.5,
      "end_time": 136.2,
      "text": "Good thinking. How would you handle the case where the same long URL is submitted multiple times?"
    },
    {
      "speaker_id": "speaker_2",
      "start_time": 136.8,
      "end_time": 149.4,
      "text": "I could maintain a hash table mapping long URLs to short URLs. Before generating a new short URL, I'd check if the long URL already exists and return the existing short URL if it does."

      "start_time": 150.0,

      "start_time": 159.3,
      "end_time": 174.8,

      "start_time": 175.4,
      "end_time": 189.1,
      "text": "We implemented the strangler fig pattern, gradually extracting services while keeping the monolith running. We also used event sourcing to maintain data consistency and enable rollbacks if needed."

      "start_time": 189.7,

      "start_time": 212.2,
